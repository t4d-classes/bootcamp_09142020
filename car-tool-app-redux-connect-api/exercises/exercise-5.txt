Exercise 5

1. Display a history of calculator operations under the calculator buttons. For each history entry display the operation name ('Add', 'Subtract', etc...) and the operation value.

2. Add a new button labeled 'Clear' which will clear the history, set the result to 0, and set the numInput to 0. Do not move the numInput to Redux.

3. Ensure it works. Good luck! Bon chance!
