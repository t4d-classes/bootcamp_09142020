Exercise 1

1. Add a column to the table of cars. The column should have a column header text of 'Actions'.

2. Create a new component named View Car Row (please pay attention to the singular name of the component). Move the table row for displaying a car to the View Car Row component. Use the View Car Row component in Car Table.

3. Add a column to View Car Row, in the column place a button labeled with Delete.

4. When the Delete button is clicked, remove the Car from the table.

Consider using the array filter function to perform the delete. Filter works similar to map.

5. Ensure it works.
